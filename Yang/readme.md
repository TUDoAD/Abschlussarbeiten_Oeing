# Automated HAZOP analysis & risk analysis
The concept of this automated HAZOP analysis & risk analysis tool is based on preHAZOP (see preHAZOP [^1]). 

Optimization points of automated preHAZOP:

- Based on pressure zones
- Analysis with a relational SQL database
- Process medium is considered
- Self-integrated scenarios such as reactor runaway scenario; corrosion scenario for piping and equipment
